# AuthenticationCrack

The file password.txt contains a hashed password for a user that you need to access their account. 

Here's what you know: 
1. The password is encrypted using MD5 (but you're totally smart enough that you could have figured that out based on how long the hashed output was)
2. You're unsure on the password requirements. There could be numbers, uppercase, lowercase...or not. 

Choose one of the following three methods: 
1. Brute Force
2. Dictionary Attack
3. Rainbow Tables

Which will be most effective and why?
